		<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
		<p>My name is Kathy (Kexin 可心) Han and I am a graduating senior with an engineering major. I had two full-time co-op experience and they are both Software Developer positions. Because of this, I has some experience with all stages of web development. Besides coding, I am also interested in UX design and Game design as well.
		</p>
		<h2>WHY ENGINEERING MAJOR?</h2>
		<p>I started with technical topics with the intrests in robots at a technology workshop. I was a Media Production major student at Temple University and at that point I decided that I want to change my major to Computer Engineering and transfer to Drexel University. Later then, while I am working on those Web Dev positions, I feel like I am doing better in IT industry and more interested in the related positions. So I transferred into Bachelor Science of Engineering program to have some free credits to learn more about programming and designing for different applications.
		</p>
        <h2>FUTURE PLANS?</h2>
		<p>I am planning to work further on developer jobs for at least one or two years after graduation. Then I plan to pursue a Master Degree in Human Computer Interaction or Information Technology or Computer Science.</p>
		<h2>OTHER HOBBIES?</h2>
		<p>I have a lot of hobbies I would love to participate in for my free time. I love to experience different kinds of video games and giving out comments based on my personal feelings about the games. I am happy to do all kinds of outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing and etc. And definitely, I would love to just hang out around the city and look for good restaurants or just cooking at home!
