This website is the portfolio for a New Zealand Web Designer and Developer. I love this website because it has a very simple structure. The only two sections of the website are Projects and Contact information. Each project that this developer worked with has a single area with a clickable button linked to the project's website.
The idea I learned from this website is that it makes sense to keep things simple.

This is a portfolio website for a Korean digital art director who lives in Paris. Instead of having the website directed via menu bar, the sections of this website go through more like a story or movie. It has advantages and disadvantages at the same time. It is definitely creative but sometimes may be hard for the user to know how to find out more content. Because the instruction line "Scroll or die" has small font at the very bottom of the home page. 
I learned a lot from this kind of approch on how to display the content.

It is a collaboration project website that have students and professionals working together to enable digital artwork on one platform. The main thing I learned from this website is how to using shapes and blocks for different people to work together. However, this method is kind of making the information limited on the pages. But still, it is a great way to showing different artwork materials.
